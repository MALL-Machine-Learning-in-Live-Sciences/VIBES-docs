The package works with three types of input data: matrix, dataframe and phyloseq. In case the provided object is a phyloseq the package automatically extracts the matrix of interest to execute the rest. In case the object is a dataframe or a matrix the samples must be in the rows and the species in the columns. The 20 species used by the package are as follows, and regardless of the object passed must be named as such ( Genus_species ): Aerococcus_christensenii, Campylobacter_ureolyticus, Finegoldia_magna, Lactobacillus_crispatus, Lactobacillus_gasseri, Porphyromonas_uenonis, Prevotella_bivia, Prevotella_timonensis, Atopobium_vaginae, Lactobacillus_iners, Prevotella_amnii, Prevotella_disiens, Staphylococcus_haemolyticus, Veillonella_montpellierensis, Alistipes_finegoldii, Gardnerella_vaginalis, Mycoplasma_hominis, Mobiluncus_mulieris, Prevotella_buccalis and Sneathia_sanguinegens.
